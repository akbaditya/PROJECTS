OVERVIEW:
- This project uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
The dataset is highly imbalanced, so SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) is used to balance it.
The model was trained with multiple optimizers (Adam, RMSprop, SGD) and activation functions (ReLU, Tanh) to find the best-performing combination.
