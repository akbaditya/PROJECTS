The Credit Card Fraud Detection project uses deep learning to identify fraudulent transactions  
within a highly imbalanced dataset. It applies **SMOTE** to balance data and improve model  
learning. Using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, the neural network is trained with different  
activation functions and optimizers to find the best configuration. Metrics such as Precision,  
Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy evaluate performance. The project highlights how preprocessing,  
data balancing, and fine-tuning significantly enhance fraud detection accuracy and financial security.
